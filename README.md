    This is a web app for connecting and sending data to the 94Fifty Bluetooth
basketball. It can pair with the basketball without error; however, I have no
way to check if the data is sent properly since the ball doesn't respond. I
believe it doesn't respond because the data I sent wasn't formatted correctly.
I couldn't figure out how the token was generated (the second element in the
data, directly following TYPE).
    I left console.log() debugging output so that anyone wanting to play with
the code will have an easier time understanding what is happening behind the
scenes.
